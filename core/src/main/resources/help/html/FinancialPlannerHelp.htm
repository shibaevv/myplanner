<H2><A NAME="noteondatacollection"></A>Note on Data Collection</H2>
<P>Some data is necessary to create a financial plan, some is collected for Client Relationship Management Purposes.</P>
<P>All information collected can be used in the plan writer, however not all fields are essential to creating a financial plan. For example, all contact details, including mobile phone numbers can be collected, however these are not generally required for a financial plan document.</P>
<H1><A NAME="step1"></A>Step 1. Data Collection - Input Clients Present Position</H1>
<P><A NAME="PresentPositionClient"></A></P>
<P>To create a reliable and accurate financial plan, you must have a good summary of your client's present position.</P>
<P>This includes identifying the client, understanding their risk profile, and understanding their assets, liabilities, income and expenses.</P>
<P>To input a client's present position you will need to:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Add your client (s) personal details </LI>
<LI>Add your clients (s) Risk Profile (Analysis) </LI>
<LI>Add your clients existing Financial Details, (Analysis)</LI></UL>

<P>This is performed in from the Client data menu option.</P>
<P>FinancialPlanner will help you develop plans for individual clients, whether they are single, married or partnered.</P>
<P>Note: Creating a plan for an entity (e.g SMSF) can be achieved by entering the SMSF as the client.</P>
<H2><A NAME="step1clientdetails"></A>Client Details</H2>
<P>We recommend that you complete as much data as possible in Client Details to ensure that information is available in other parts of the software.</P>
<P>You can enter information under the following categories.</P>

<UL>
<LI><A HREF="#BCD">Basic Client Details (Name, Date of Birth etc) </A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="#CD">Contact Details </A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="#Dependents">Dependents </A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="#ClientContacts">Client Contacts </A></LI>
<LI><A HREF="#GoalsandInterests">Goals and Interests </A></LI></UL>

<P>If your client has a partner, you will also need to enter information in the Partner details screens.</P>
<P>The following data will enable the standard plan pages to produce sufficient results:</P>
<P>The table below is an example of how the client information is used.</P>

<P>Searching for Managed Funds and Shares using the Search Option</P>
<P>Managed Funds and Share information can be searched using the software databases which is derived from Morningstar and IRESS information. Note that the database contains both managed funds and shares within the same list.</P>
<P>To find the appropriate share or managed fund, you must select the &amp;lsquo;Search' button and type the first few characters of the fund name in the description field.</P>
<P>For example, if you are searching for an AMP Managed Fund, you can just write AMP in the description box and the software will display a list of the AMP managed funds in the database. You can then select a managed fund by pressing the OPK button.</P>
<P>If you already know the funds investment code you can search by investment code in the second description box.</P>
<P>Shares can be quickly added by using the Investment code search option and entering the three-letter ASX code. E.g. to enter a Portfolio Shares as an asset, you only have to enter FPS in the second box, select FPS share and select OK. The current share price will be displayed in the financials.</P>
<H4>Managed Funds &amp; Shares</H4>
<P>You can record the financial details of your clients Managed Funds and Shares.</P>
<P>You may also record any wrap / administration services your client holds. For example, if you are entering the details of a client with an existing Investment account, you may wish to enter the entire portfolio under the one heading &amp;ldquo;Investment Service&amp;rdquo; rather than record each underlying fund separately.</P>
<P>You may also wish to group your clients share portfolio into one heading titled &amp;lsquo;Australian Share Portfolio rather than record each share individually. This decision will depend on your and the service you are offering your clients.</P>

<P>Also, you are unlikely to have regular contributions from property investments.</P>

<P>The Wealth Analysis tool projects the value of your client's assets and liabilities for a future period of time (usually used to project capital until retirement). It is a combined view of your clients, partners and jointly held assets.</P>
<P>Wealth Analysis uses the information you have entered in the financials (or changed in strategy Creator) and projects forward each asset and liability. If you wish to change any of the earnings or other assumptions, you must change them in the financials screen (or create a new strategy).</P>
<P>There are three sections (tabs) in Wealth Analysis.</P>

<P>You may perform the same financial analysis on the restructured financial data as you preformed on the original financial data.</P>
<H3><A NAME="step3strategycreator"></A>Strategy Creator Overview</H3>
<P>The Strategy Creator allows you to reallocate a client's investments to new investment assets. Also, you can change the client's income and expenditure, (and invest the surplus income). </P>
<P>You are presented with two tables in Strategy Creator for the "before and after" views of your clients position.</P>
<P>The top table is the clients existing Financials titled "Source of Funds". This data is the same information as you entered in the financials screen. To change this data, you should close the strategy creator and edit the information in the Client Data - Financials screen.</P>
<P>The bottom table is your workspace to set up their new financial details and is called "Application of funds".</P>

<P>Application of Funds = New Financials</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
</B><H3><A NAME="step3newstrategy"><A NAME="newstrategystep1"></A></A>Adding a new Recommended Strategy. </H3>
<P>A recommended strategy is a description of the general strategy that you wish to adopt for the client. You do not need to select specific investments at this stage.</P>
<P>Example Strategy descriptions are:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Installment Gearing, or Lump Sum Gearing </LI>
<LI>Regular Savings or Regular investment Plan </LI>
<LI>Combine Superannuation Funds </LI>
<LI>Repay Home Loan Debt </LI>
<LI>Sell Shares and buy Managed Funds </LI>
<LI>Change Investment Administration Providers </LI>
<LI>Change Income Stream providers</LI></UL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>To enter a recommended strategy:</P>
<OL>

<LI>Highlight the "Recommendations" title in the "Application of Funds" (shown below) </LI>
<LI>Then press "Add item" and then type the strategy description. There is no limit to the number of strategies you can employ in the one plan. A strategy description is a descriptive term for the strategy that you are employing.</LI>
<LI>Then type a general name to describe the recommended Strategy. (E.g. Combine Super Funds, Investment Plan etc)</LI></OL>

<P>You may enter all your strategies one after another.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3><A NAME="step3source"></A>Selecting the Source of Funds</H3>
<P>Once you have itemised your strategies, you must select which assets are going to be used to fund the Strategies.</P>
<OL>

<LI>Select an Asset from the Source of Funds window that you wish to transfer to your strategy.</LI>
<LI>Select the amount of funds from the asset to transfer to the strategy.</LI>
<P>The default value is the full amount of the asset. If you only wish to transfer a portion of the amount, tick the asset in the "Use" Column as shown below, and enter the amount that you wish to take from that asset and apply to your strategy.</P>
<P>You may select more than one asset to fund your strategy. In this case you will need to select each asset and an amount from each asset</P>
<LI>Select the Strategy that is to accept the funds. You must highlight the "Source of Funds" row (shown below) to be able to transfer the funds to the strategy.</LI>
<LI>Transfer these funds by pressing the 'down arrow' button in between the Source and the Application of Funds windows. (button shown below)</LI>
<B><P>&nbsp;<IMG SRC="Image35.gif" WIDTH=292 HEIGHT=46></P>
</B><LI>Once you have completed all strategies, you then transfer the remaining untouched financials to the bottom Window by pressing the transfer financials button.</LI></OL>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<H3><A NAME="step3debt"></A>Paying off Debts</H3>
<P>Paying a debt is very similar to adding a Strategy. You must first set up the recommendation in the Application of funds. For example, you may use a title such as "Repay Car Loan".</P>
<P>Then you follow the following steps:</P>

<H3><A NAME="assumptionsinvstartegy"></A>Investment Strategy Earnings</H3>
<P>The earnings figures used for the seven Investment Strategies are based on the forecasted returns from optomised investment strategies using the Investment Service.</P>
<P>The estimated earnings for income and growth are shown net of competitive Management Fees, and net of underlying fund manager fees. They are based on an average investment of $600,000 in the Service.</P>
<P>They are not net of Adviser Portfolio Review Fees.</P>
<H3><A NAME="assumptionscompundernings"></A>Compounding Earnings</H3>
<P>Earnings are generally compounded on an annual basis.</P>
<H2><A NAME="calcap"></A>Allocated Pension Calculator</H2>
<P><A NAME="APC"><A NAME="AllocatedPensionCalculator"></A></A></P>
<P>The Allocated Pension calculator allows you to prepare long term simulations of your clients allocated pension income stream. </P>
<P>In addition, you will be able to estimate the first year income payments (minimum and maximums) and deductible amounts.</P>
<P>To prepare an Allocated Pension simulation you must enter the following details:</P>
<H3><A NAME="calcapclientdetails"></A>Client Details</H3>
<P>Client details includes basic client information. If you are using a client that has already been saved, some of the clients details may already be available in the Allocated Pension simulation. These can be adjusted if required.</P>
<H4>Client Name</H4>
<P>Enter the clients name as you would like it to appear on your reports.</P>
<H4>DOB (date of Birth)</H4>
<P>Enter the clients Date of Birth. This is essential for calculating the clients age, and their life expectancy, and minimum and maximum pension payments.</P>
<H4>Pension Start Date</H4>
<P>Enter the date you wish to commence the pension. Generally, pensions can commence at any time. Note you may enter a date in the past if you wish to project an existing pension.</P>
<P>Note, as with all date fields, you must enter dates as DD/MM/YYYY.</P>
<H4>First Payment Date.</H4>
<P>You may enter a date for the first actual payment. Allocated Pensions are paid on the 15<SUP>th</SUP> of each month. Generally, the first pension payment should be at least a couple of weeks after the Pension Start Date.</P>
<H4>Sex</H4>
<P>You must enter the gender of your client. This is essential for calculating the clients age, and their life expectancy, and minimum and maximum pension payments.</P>
<H4>Age at Pension Start Date</H4>
<P>This will automatically be calculated for you.</P>
<H4>Eligible Service Period</H4>
<P>You must enter an Eligible Service Period to ensure that the ETP components are calculated correctly. If you have not entered a date, you will be reminded when you try to enter the ETP details.</P>
<H4>R/O from Pre 1994 Pension</H4>
<P>You can check this box if the client's existing pension was established prior to July 1994. By default the selection is &amp;lsquo;No'.</P>
<P>If the pension is to be rolled over in full to the new pension that you are simulating, then the Undeducted Purchase price (UPP) will differ to reflect the higher UPP for the pre 1994 pension.</P>
<H3><A NAME="calcappensionoptions"></A>Pension Options</H3>
<H4>General Tax Exemption Claimed</H4>

<H2><A NAME="calcetp"></A>ETP / Rollover Calculator</H2>
<P><A NAME="ETPC"></A></P>
<P>The ETP / Rollover calculator is used to determine the tax payable on the withdrawn components of an ETP.</P>
<P>The ETP calculator can also link to the allocated pension calculator should you select these options.</P>
<P>If you already have a saved client, some of the client details will be available in the ETP / Rollover Calculator. You can change these fields if required.</P>
<P>You may save and report multiple ETP Withdrawal options. These can be used in your plan document.</P>
<P>The following fields need to be completed to prepare a calculation.</P>
<H3>DOB &amp; Client Age</H3>
<P>You must enter the client's date of birth.</P>
<P>If the client is over age 55, the option to add any used tax-free threshold will not be available.</P>
<P>He clients age is automatically calculated.</P>
<H3>Calculation date</H3>
<P>A calculation date (DD/MM/YYYY) must be entered so that the calculator can work out the correct Eligible Service Period and components as at the date of calculation. You can enter a future date if required.</P>
<H3>Eligible Service Period</H3>
<P>You must enter the Eligible Service start date of the ETP amount. The eligible service period is calculated based on the days between this date and the calculation date.</P>
<H3>Tax Rate</H3>
<P>This field allows you to enter an estimated marginal tax rate for the client. Assessable portions of income from the withdrawn ETP (e.g. 5% of the Pre 1983 component) will be taxed at the rate of tax you have entered.</P>
<P>For example, if you client is on the highest tax bracket (already earning over $60,000) per year, you can enter the highest rate of tax of 48.5%. (Including Medicare).</P>
<H3>Post 30/6/1983 tax-free used</H3>
<P>If your client is over age 55, a portion of the post June 1983 component can be withdrawn without incurring tax.</P>
<P>This tax-free amount reduces by any previously withdrawn tax-free amounts.</P>
<P>If your client has already used a portion of the tax-free threshold, you must enter that amount here. The calculator will then determine the remaining portion that is tax free.</P>
<P>By default the field is empty, assuming that the full post June tax-free threshold is available for your client.</P>
<H3>Total ETP</H3>
<P>Enter the total ETP amount.</P>
<P>Note: The calculator allows you to perform partial withdrawal calculations, therefore you may enter the total ETP amount.</P>
<P>The software will determine the portions of Pre and Post 1983 components.</P>
<P>Note: If the ETP consists of other components, such as undeducted contributions, you are able to enter these dollar amounts in the ETP Allocation input fields. The software will then correct the pre and post 1983 components.</P>
